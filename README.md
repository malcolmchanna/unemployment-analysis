 <h1>Unemployment Data Analysis</h1>

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>This repository contains code for analyzing unemployment data in India. The code performs data cleaning, visualization, and provides insights into various aspects of unemployment, including average unemployment rates, employment numbers, labor participation rates, regional comparisons, and correlations.</p>

  <h2>Code</h2>
  <p>The code is written in Python and utilizes popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It loads the datasets, performs data cleaning by handling missing values, and conducts various analyses. The code generates visualizations, including line plots, bar plots, and pie charts, to present the findings.</p>

  <h2>Analysis Results</h2>
  <p>The analysis reveals insights into the unemployment situation in India. Key findings include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Average unemployment rates vary across regions, with Haryana and Tripura having the highest rates.</li>
    <li>Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have the highest estimated unemployment rates, while West Bengal has the third-highest rate.</li>
    <li>Meghalaya, Tripura, and Telangana have the highest labor participation rates among regions.</li>
    <li>Unemployment rates and labor participation rates exhibit certain trends over time.</li>
    <li>There is a correlation between unemployment rates and the number of employed individuals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use this code, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the "unemployment_data.csv" and "unemployment_rate_data.csv" files and place them in the same directory as the code.</li>
    <li>Install the required libraries by running <code>pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn</code>.</li>

<h1>Sales Prediction</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains code for predicting sales based on advertising data using machine learning techniques. The code utilizes the popular Python programming language and various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used in this project is "Advertising.csv," which includes information about advertising expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper, along with corresponding sales figures.</p>
<h2>Code Overview</h2>
<p>The code performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loading the dataset and performing initial data exploration</li>
  <li>Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and renaming columns</li>
  <li>Visualizing the distribution of sales, advertising expenditure by media, and individual media distributions</li>
  <li>Calculating various statistics such as mean, sum, and difference between columns</li>
  <li>Building a linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising expenditure</li>
  <li>Evaluating the model's performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)</li>
  <li>Examining the coefficients and intercept of the model</li>
  <li>Analyzing feature importance</li>
  <li>Predicting sales for new data</li>
  <li>Performing residual analysis to assess model performance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Analysis Results</h2>
<p>The analysis reveals insights into the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TV advertising expenditure has the highest impact on sales, followed by Radio and Newspaper.</li>
  <li>The linear regression model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting sales based on advertising expenditure.</li>
  <li>Residual analysis indicates that the model performs reasonably well, with the residuals centered around zero.</li>
</ul>
