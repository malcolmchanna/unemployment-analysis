<h1>Sales Prediction</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains code for predicting sales based on advertising data using machine learning techniques. The code utilizes the popular Python programming language and various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used in this project is "Advertising.csv," which includes information about advertising expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper, along with corresponding sales figures.</p>
<h2>Code Overview</h2>
<p>The code performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loading the dataset and performing initial data exploration</li>
  <li>Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and renaming columns</li>
  <li>Visualizing the distribution of sales, advertising expenditure by media, and individual media distributions</li>
  <li>Calculating various statistics such as mean, sum, and difference between columns</li>
  <li>Building a linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising expenditure</li>
  <li>Evaluating the model's performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)</li>
  <li>Examining the coefficients and intercept of the model</li>
  <li>Analyzing feature importance</li>
  <li>Predicting sales for new data</li>
  <li>Performing residual analysis to assess model performance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Analysis Results</h2>
<p>The analysis reveals insights into the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TV advertising expenditure has the highest impact on sales, followed by Radio and Newspaper.</li>
  <li>The linear regression model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting sales based on advertising expenditure.</li>
  <li>Residual analysis indicates that the model performs reasonably well, with the residuals centered around zero.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use this code, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the "Advertising.csv" file and place it in the same directory as the code.</li>
  <li>Install the required libraries by running <code>pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn</code>.</li>
  <li>Run the code in a Python environment or IDE.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements or use it as a reference for similar sales prediction projects.</p>
